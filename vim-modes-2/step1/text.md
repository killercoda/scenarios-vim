**Visual mode** is an advanced mode in vim and can be used for navigation and manipulation of text selections 

>   It allows the use of most Normal mode commands on selected text

&nbsp;

In this scenario, we are going to install some vim plugins to change the visual appearance of vim, to be able to better understand how modes are functioning:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/amix/vimrc.git ~/.vim_runtime
```{{exec}}

```bash
sh ~/.vim_runtime/install_awesome_vimrc.sh
```{{exec}}
