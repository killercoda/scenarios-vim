Vim has a lot of functionality to make editing very easy for users.

Let's learn your first steps with the console based editor Vim!

&nbsp;

First open a new file:

```plain
vim my-file
```{{exec}}
```

Next type `i` to get into the insert-mode. The mode is shown on bottom left

Now type any text, like `hello world`!

To get into command-mode press `Esc`{{}}

To save the file we need to type `:x` and confirm with `Enter`{{}}

This will close Vim and we can view the newly created file:

```plain
cat my-file
```{{exec}}
